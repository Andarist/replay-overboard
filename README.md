# Overboard (⚠️ wip)

Welcome to Overboard, the ficticious online store that has a few bugs that need your help fixing! This site is a showcase of various bugs in a simplified React application to help demonstrate how Replay helps you debug your application.

## Development

```
npm install
```

This site uses NextJS, which is a framework for building server-side rendered React applications. To start the server, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm run dev
```

### Screenshots

While the local server is running you can generate screenshots of the site by running the following:

```
npm run screenshot
```

### Hoverboard Model

To view the hoverboard model, append the following query string to the URL:

```
?three=true
```

Optionally enable orbit controls for posing the model:

```
?three=true&orbit=true
```
